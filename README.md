# üîç Bing Search Automation with AI Phrase Generator

This project automates Bing searches using **AI-generated random short phrases**.  
It was designed to help with automatic query farming (e.g., Microsoft Rewards) in a way that mimics natural typing and browsing behavior.  

The program uses:
- **HuggingFace Transformers** for text generation (GPT-based short phrases).
- **Selenium + undetected-chromedriver** for browser automation.
- **Tkinter** for a simple user interface. (Not yet done)


#
